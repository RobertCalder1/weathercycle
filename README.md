# Weather Cycle

This app helps users to achieve KOM/QOM on Strava segments with the integration of wind forecasts.

## Description

The app allows you to search for the top 10 segments of Strava in one specific area.

Users are able to search for the city/suburb/street that you like or also navigate with the interactive map.

The top 10 segments are displayed in a table under the map. You are able to show the segment on the map when clicking on one of them. The table also shows you the direction of that segment and some data about that segment.

The weather widget shows tomorrow's and current wind speed and direction. It is color coded depending on the wind speed (grey for low speed, green for moderate and orange for strong winds).

The directions of the segment that is displayed on the table is also color coded. If the segment direction is within 90 degrees of the current wind direction, the background color will be green and it will indicate that is a good segment to try because you will have the help of the wind pushing you, otherwise it will be grey.
